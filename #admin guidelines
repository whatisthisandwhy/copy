Guidelines Reference!
This List all Guidelines, that Administrators are REQUIRED to meet at all times.
  First and foremost, this is problably obvious, but as an Admin. You have permissions to 
  do anything on the Server the Discord API allows you, except Owner Only actions.
  And that comes with Alot of responsibilty. Please make sure to folllow the guidelines 
  carefully, as almost every Guideline will result in being SUSPENDED and or if you are 
  lucky only demoted. WARNING: Assiting in a raid will result in inappealable Punishment!

#1: You, should make sure to Not delete any active channels and changes to them shouldn't be too 
severe or possibly cause damage to them. However you are free to Change or delete any unused or 
extremely inactive channels. Please make sure to receive permission for any active channels first. 
#2: If you want to make changes to the Servers name, you should consult the Owner, and please make
sure its not anything inappropriate, or otherwise not ethical.
#3: If a staff Member, is abusing. you should punish them accordingly, and must keep an eye on the 
logs, to make sure you don't miss any suspicious activity. You can also invite administrative Bots,
by consulting the Owner, in order to help you in Managing the Servers Structure!
#4: Do not, edit any required roles, such as moderator Roles, without permission. as doing so will 
result in punishment. however you may freely edit or remove any miscellanous Roles, with positive 
support by Members ofcourse.
#5: You Shouldn't edit this channel or its contents. And you shouldn't edit any channel in 
STAFF ONLY the same goes for SUSPENDED, and trying to change that category in a fashion that might, 
make it easier or any abusive staff member to bypass the restrictions will result in getting
suspended yourself. Also don't try to change the Rules in #guidelines without permission 
by the Owner. failing to meet this will result in punishment.
#6: I know this isn't Alot to ask. So, Please. Do not act unprofessional, or give other 
Staff Members a bad example. You should also try to refrain from being less soft to members if they
are your friends, same for any other member. Or even a staff member.
#7: ***For Safety Reason:*** You MUST __Enable 2FA__ otherwise, the Owner, me. Will sadly be forced
to demote you. And also please make sure to keep up good safety measures, such as making sure you
don't get  token loggers or anything like that. Please be careful and thank you!
#8: You should also, NOT accept appeals from Staff members, who have been severely abusive,
Or have assisted in a Raid. however for staff members who haven't been abusive, and whose appeals
are justifiable. you can reinstate their privilege.
